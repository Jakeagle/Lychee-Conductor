## [3.2.2] - 2026-03-06

### Hotfix: Character Naming Consistency

**Fixed**: Fats character (keyboardist) now correctly displays in the character tester and show editor.

#### Problem

The character was defined as `"Fats"` in the authoritative source (character-movements.js, constants.py, show_bridge.py) but referenced as `"Fatz"` in UI configuration arrays and legacy imports, causing the UI to skip rendering the character entirely.

#### Solution

Standardized naming to `"Fats"` (with lowercase 't') across all files:

- **index.html**: Updated character order arrays and color mappings (3 locations)
- **app.js**: Fixed BAND_CONFIG rock band character reference
- **showtapes.js**: Fixed all show choreography references (12 locations)
- **show_bridge.py**: Fixed SAM (Show Analysis Module) character key

#### Impact

- ✅ Fats character now renders in tester panel with correct purple color
- ✅ All 16 Fats movements (eyelids, eyes, mouth, head, arms, elbows, foot tap, body lean) accessible
- ✅ Pre-made shows using Fats choreography function correctly
- ✅ AI show generation via SAM includes Fats in analysis

#### Files Modified

- index.html (3 changes)
- app.js (1 change)
- showtapes.js (12 changes)
- SCME/SAM/show_bridge.py (1 change)

### Notes for Developers

- When adding new movements, ensure bit index consistency across all three maps:
  1. character-movements.js (0-based)
  2. export_bridge.py \_CHAR_MOV_BITS (0-based)
  3. export_bridge.py \_TD_CH / \_BD_CH (1-based)
- RAE_CHARS in signal-visualizer.js must be updated for new character groups
- HTML show-builder UI automatically picks up new controls from CHARACTER_MOVEMENTS global

## [3.0] - 2026-02-25

### Timeline Show Editor & Character-Centric Architecture

Major architectural shift to timeline-based show editing with character-centric data model.

#### New Features

- **Standalone Timeline Editor (editor.html)**:
  - Full DAW-style visual show editor with dark theme
  - Ruler with MM:SS timestamps and frame numbers (auto-scaling zoom)
  - One track row per movement, grouped by character with colored headers
  - Signal blocks rendered as colored bars (ON→OFF pairs)
  - Click+drag empty row to create new signal blocks
  - Click block to select, Delete key to remove
  - Click ruler to seek playhead
  - Web Audio API WAV playback synced to playhead
  - Space = play/pause, Arrow keys = step ±5/50 frames, +/- = zoom

- **Character-Centric Show Export Format**:
  - New v3.0 format groups signals per character instead of flat timeline
  - Each character block has track (TD/BD) and signals[] array
  - Each signal: frame, timestamp (MM:SS.mmm for reference), movement, bit, state, note
  - Backwards compatible: import handles both v3.0 (characters{}) and v2.1 legacy (sequences[])
  - Duration in both frame and millisecond formats

#### Architecture Changes

- **Signals Model**:
  - Moved from loose sequence arrays to character-organized structure
  - state field (true=ON, false=OFF) replaces stateless data arrays
  - Per-signal notes and timestamps for documentation

- **Show Definition**:
  - Band reference (rock/munch)
  - BPM for timing calculations
  - Character-grouped movement sequences
  - Metadata (title, description, duration)

#### Validation & Compatibility

- Import validation: checks band, character names, movement keys
- Legacy format auto-detection and conversion
- Skips invalid cues with warning count
- Duration calculation from last cue or user specification

#### Technical Details

- Frame-to-millisecond conversion: 1 frame = 20ms (50 FPS)
- Timestamp field is write-once reference only; import drives timing from frame
- Both v3.0 and v2.1 formats supported simultaneously

#### Files Modified

- New: editor.html (standalone editor)
- app.js (character-centric export/import)
- styles.css (editor styling)
- character-movements.js (data source)

**Commits**: `5fa6c76` (character-centric format), `62c022d` (timeline editor)

- **Movement Aliasing**:
  - Show builder can use friendly names (guitar, hip_sway, blink)
  - Automatic mapping to canonical CHARACTER_MOVEMENTS keys
  - 50+ aliases for common show choreography terms

#### Technical Components
