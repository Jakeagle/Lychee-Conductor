# Research — Reference Materials and Technical Findings

This folder contains all technical reference material accumulated during development. It is the "why we know what we know" section — sources, experiments, confirmed constants, and the history of research decisions.

## Key Source Documents

The following external sources informed the project. They are not reproduced here due to copyright, but their file names are referenced:

## How Confidence Levels Are Assigned

Throughout this documentation and the code comments, you may see notes like "KWS-confirmed" or "TBD". These mean:

| Label                   | Meaning                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **KWS-confirmed**       | Verified against multiple Known-Working Show WAV files; high confidence |
| **Source-confirmed**    | Verified against RR-Engine C# source code                               |
| **Community-confirmed** | Corroborated by two or more independent community sources               |
| **Working hypothesis**  | Has not been disproven but is inferred, not measured                    |

## What We Still Don't Know

These are open research questions as of March 2026:

1. **Munch band full bit chart** — we have the RAE (Rock-Afire) bit chart complete; the Munch band layout is partially inferred
2. **CSO decoder for RR-Engine** — the `.cso` (Cyberstar Online) format was designed for a future decoder to be built into RR-Engine, but that decoder has not been implemented; the format spec is locked but integration work is pending
3. **Video track format** — the `videoData` field in `.rshw` is present but its internal encoding is unknown (no shows with video have been tested)
