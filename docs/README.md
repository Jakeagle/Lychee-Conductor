# Cyberstar Simulator — Documentation

Welcome to the project documentation. This folder covers everything about how the Cyberstar Simulator works, from the browser UI down to the BitArray that gets written into an `.rshw` file.

Use the sections below to find what you're looking for.

## What is this project?

The Cyberstar Simulator is a browser-based tool for creating, previewing, and exporting animatronic show content (showtapes) for the **Rock-Afire Explosion (RAE)** animatronic system. It bridges two worlds:

- **The browser** — where a user draws choreography in a piano roll editor, previews animated characters in the 4ch Tester, and exports a validated showtape.
- **RR-Engine / SPTE** — the Unity 3D game where showtapes are loaded and played back through the animatronic hardware. SPTE (Showbiz Pizza Time Experience) is a mod of RR-Engine, which is the open-source base game.

The core challenge is translating a choreography timeline (character movements at specific timestamps) into a precise hardware-compatible binary signal stream that SPTE can read and replay.
